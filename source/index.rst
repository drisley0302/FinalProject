About our Small Spiral Notebooks
================================

At |llc|, we create a large variety of small notebooks. We place our fine art reproductions, illustrations, and map prints on the front covers.  This document describes in detail how to layout a Photoshop file to print multiple front covers for a certain size of notebooks. It is one step in the process of creating notebooks. You can learn more about creating spiral notebooks at: |mainDocNotebooks|. To request information about the availability of these notebooks, email |emailInfoLLC|.

Spiral Notebook Specifications
==============================

This document describes the multiple cover layout for #2 |szNm2| notebooks that have a trim size of |szTrimShort2| x |szTrimLong2|. We assume a bleed of 1/4" all around. The orientation is for *vertical* images, and the wire spiral placement is at the *top*.

Please note that the steps to create the front cover layout are the same whether the notebook thickness is |Thin| or |Chunky|.

Requirements
============

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* Printer that you will use to create the front covers
* Strong light source in a darkened room, for checking the test printout
* Regular paper, at least one sheet but maybe more if adjustments are needed
