About our Small Spiral Notebooks
================================

.. index:: main documentation

At |llc|, we create a large variety of small notebooks. We place our fine art reproductions, illustrations, and map prints on the front covers.  This document describes in detail how to layout a Photoshop file to print multiple front covers for a certain size of notebooks. It is one phase in the process of creating notebooks. You can learn more about creating spiral notebooks at: |mainDocNotebooks|. To request information about the availability of these notebooks and other art, email |emailInfoLLC| or visit |websiteLLC|.

Example Front cover layout
==========================

When you finish the steps in this document, you will have a test printout that looks similar to the pictures below. You will print on both sides of a single sheet of paper. The pictures show each side of the same piece of paper.

Spiral Notebook Specifications
==============================

This document describes the multiple cover layout for #2 |szNm2| notebooks that have a trim size of |szTrimShort2| x |szTrimLong2|. We assume a bleed of 1/4" all around. The orientation is for *vertical* images, and the wire spiral placement is at the *top*. You will be able to fit eight covers on a single sheet of paper.

Please note that the steps to create the front cover layout are the same whether the notebook thickness is |Thin| or |Chunky|.

* Computer running Photoshop (we use Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* Individual files for the images, already laid out
* Individual files for the information inside, already laid out
* Printer that you will use to create the front covers (we use an Epson Workforce WF-7210)
