Test Printing
#############

In this step, you will produce a test print to check for alignment. If anything needs adjusting, go back and correct it, then do another test print.

Requirements
============

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* New Photoshop file that you just created
* Printer that you will use to create the front covers
* Strong light source in a darkened room, for checking the test printout
* Regular paper, at least one sheet but maybe more if adjustments are needed

Steps
=====

#. Create a printout:
   #. Gather at least one piece of regular paper.
   #. File> Print> Understand all the printer settings. Print.
   #. Turn paper over and insert top edge first into printer.
   #. Hide "info" layer group. Show "images" layer group.
   #. Print second side (printer settings should be remembered).
#. Look at the printout:
   #. Set up the lighting in the room.
   #. Check trim marks.
   #. Check that info matches the images.
