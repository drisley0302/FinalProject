Test Printing
#############

.. index:: test printing

In this section, you will produce a test print to check for alignment. If anything needs adjusting, go back and correct it, then do another test print.

Requirements
============

For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* New Photoshop file that you just created
* Printer that you will use to create the front covers (we use an Epson Workforce WF-7210)
* Regular paper, at least one sheet but maybe more if adjustments are needed
* Strong light source easily reachable in a darkened room, for checking the test printout

Steps
=====

A. Create a Test Printout
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Gather at least one piece of regular paper.

#. From the *File* menu, select *Print*. Understand all the printer settings. File> Print> settings: Portrait
check borderless, click borderless Settings, check Retain Size
paper type: doesn't matter much, perhaps semi-gloss
cassette 1 or rear feeder
quality: standard
use Adobe RGB custom color settings
Check: Center Image
Uncheck: Scale to fit media
Print.

#. Turn paper over and insert top edge first into printer. We like to use either cassette 1 or the rear feeder for this printer. Pay attention to which side should be facing up in order to print on the blank side.

#. Hide "info" layer group. Show "images" layer group.

#. Print second side using same settings.  (printer settings should be remembered).

#. Save the file again to keep the printer settings.

B. Examine the Test Printout
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Set up the lighting in the room. Hold up the printout to the light.

#. Check trim marks to make they align between the front and back sides..

#. Check that info matches the correct images and make sure that the top is the same for images versus info.
