Test Printing
#############

.. index:: test printing

In this section, you will produce a test print to check for alignment. If anything needs adjusting, go back and correct it, then do another test print.

Requirements
============

For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* New Photoshop file that you just created
* Printer that you will use to create the front covers (we use an Epson Workforce WF-7210)
* Regular paper, at least one sheet but maybe more if adjustments are needed
* Strong light source easily reachable in a darkened room, for checking the test printout

Steps
=====

A. Create a Test Printout
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Gather at least one piece of regular paper.

#. From the *File* menu, select *Print...*. Make sure your printer is selected for the *Printer*. Click the **Page Setup...** button.

#. **Check** the *Borderless* checkbox, then click the **Settings...** button next to it. Click **Retain Size** then click **OK**.

#. For the *Paper Source*, select where you will be feeding the paper from. We typically use either **Paper Cassette 1** or **Rear Paper Feed Slot**.

#. Select a *Paper Type*. For the test printout, it doesn't matter much. We usually select **Premium Photo Paper Semi-Gloss" or anything that looks like it will save ink.

#. Set the *Quality* to **Standard** for the test printout to save ink.

#. At the top of the dialog, select the *More Options* tab. Under *Color Correction*, select **Custom**, then click the **Advanced...** button next to it. Click **Color Controls**, then for *Color Mode*, select **Adobe RGB** and click **OK**.

#. Click **OK** once more to return to the main *Print Dialog*.

#. Make sure that *Center Image* is **checked**.

#. Make sure that *Scale to Fit Media* is **unchecked**.

#. Make sure you have paper loaded in the printer, then click **Print**. Click **Print** on the next dialog that appears and wait for the page to print. If necessary, confirm on the printer itself what paper to use.

#. Turn the paper over and feed it top edge first into the printer. We like to use either **Paper Cassette 1** or **Rear Paper Feed Slot** for this printer. Pay attention to which side should be facing up in order to print on the blank side.

#. Hide the **info** layer group. 

#. Show the **images** layer group.

#. Print on the second side using the same printer settings, which should be automatically remembered.

#. Save the file again to keep the printer settings.

B. Examine the Test Printout
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Set up the lighting in the room. Hold up the printout to the light.

#. Check trim marks to make they align between the front and back sides..

#. Check that info matches the correct images and make sure that the top is the same for images versus info.
