Laying Out Multiple Covers on a Single Sheet
############################################

In this section, you will add images to appear on the outside front covers, then you will add the information files that will be printed on the inside of the front covers.

Requirements
============
For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* Eight individual files for the images in the correct format
* Eight individual files for the inside information in the correct format

.. index:: rasterize, rotate, place file, File Place command, group layers

Steps
=====

A. Adding Images for the Outside
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Add the first image. From the *File* menu, select *Place* and browse to select the first individual image file. Click **Place**, then press **Enter** to complete the file placement.

#. In the *Layers Panel*, right-click the placed image and select *Rasterize Layer*. Rasterizing the image removes the link to the original file. Then, if you ever move this new Photoshop file to a different folder location, you will not need re-link the image file.

#. Rotate the image. From the *Edit* menu, select *Transform*, then select *Rotate 90° CCW*. The top of the image should now be facing to the left.

#. Position the image. Select the *Move Tool*. Move the image so that it is 3/4" in from the left and flush with the top of the page.

#. Hide the *Background* layer in the *Layers Panel* so that you can see any white edges of the images better.

#. Use similar procedures to place the second image, rasterize it, and rotate it.

#. Position the second image just below the first image.

#. Similarly, place the third and fourth images, rasterize them, rotate them, and position them. Make sure that the fourth image is flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Place fifth image, rasterize it, rotate it, and position it 3/4" in from the right and flush with the top of the page. It should be just to the right of the first image.

#. Place the sixth image, rasterized and rotated, just below the fifth image.

#. Place the seventh and eighth images, rasterize them, rotate them, and position them. The eight image shoulid be flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Group all eight image layers. Name the group **images**. 

#. Hide the **images** group.

B. Adding Information on the Inside
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Pick correct information file. Insert the information files in the same order as you inserted the image files. However, you will be positioning them from right to left instead of left to right. File> Place.

#. Rasterize. Rotate in other direction. Edit> Transform> Rotate 90° CW. Position it.  Rotate in the opposite direction of the related image, on the same horizontal row, but on the opposite left vs right side as the image. The top should be on the right. Use same margins and being flush as for the images.

#. Place remaining seven images, rasterize, rotate, position.

#. Group eight layers. Name group "info".

#. File> Save the file with a meaningful filename.
