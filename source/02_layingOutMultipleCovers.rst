Laying Out Multiple Covers on a Single Sheet
############################################

In this section, you will add images to appear on the outside front covers, then you will add the information files that will be printed on the inside of the front covers.

Requirements
============
For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* Eight individual files for the images in the correct format
* Eight individual files for the inside information in the correct format

.. index:: rasterize, rotate, place file, File Place command, group layers

Steps
=====

A. Adding Images for the Outside
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Add the first image. From the *File* menu, select *Place* and browse to select the first individual image file. Click **Place**, then press **Enter** to complete the file placement.

#. In the *Layers Panel*, right-click the placed image and select *Rasterize Layer*. Rasterizing the image removes the link to the original file. Then, if you ever move this new Photoshop file to a different folder location, you will not need re-link the image file.

#. Rotate the image. From the *Edit* menu, select *Transform*, then select *Rotate 90° CCW*. The top of the image should now be facing to the left.

#. Position the image. Select the *Move Tool*. Move the image so that it is 3/4" in from the left and flush with the top of the page.

#. Hide the *Background* layer in the *Layers Panel* so that you can see any white edges of the images better.

#. Use similar procedures to place the second image, rasterize it, and rotate it.

#. Position the second image just below the first image.

#. Similarly, place the third and fourth images, rasterize them, rotate them, and position them. Make sure that the fourth image is flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Place fifth image, rasterize it, rotate it, and position it 3/4" in from the right and flush with the top of the page. It should be just to the right of the first image.

#. Place the sixth image, rasterize it, rotate it, and position it just below the fifth image.

#. Place the seventh and eighth images, rasterize them, rotate them, and position them. The eighth image should be flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Group all eight image layers by selecting *Group Layers* from the *Layer* menu. Double-click the name of the group in the *Layers Panel* and rename the group **images**. 

#. Hide the **images** group.

B. Adding Information on the Inside
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Add the individual file that contains information to be printed on the inside of the cover that matches the first image. From the *File* menu, select *Place* and browse to select that information file. Click **Place**, then press **Enter** to complete the file placement.

#. Rasterize it as you did for the image files.

#. You will now be working in opposite directions from how you positioned the image files. From the *Edit* menu, select *Transform*, then select *Rotate 90° CW*. The top of the information file should now be facing to the right (not to the left).

#. Position the information file so that it is 3/4" in from the right (not from the left) and flush with the top of the page.

#. Place the second information file. When browsing, be sure to select the matching information files in the same order as you selected the image files.

#. Rasterize the second information file, rotate it so the top is at the right, and position it just below the first information file.

#. Place the third and fourth information files, rasterize them, rotate them, and position them. The fourth file should be flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Place the fifth information file, rasterize it, rotate it, and position it 3/4" in from the left and flush with the top of the page. It should be just to the left of the first information file.

#. Place the sixth information file, rasterize it, rotate it, and position it just below the fifth information file.

#. Place the seventh and eighth information files, rasterize them, rotate them, and position them. The eighth information file should be flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Group all eight information layers. Name this group **info**.

#. Save the file with a meaningful filename.
