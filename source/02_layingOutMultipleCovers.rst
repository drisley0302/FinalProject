Laying Out Multiple Covers on a Single Sheet
############################################

In this section, you will add images to appear on the outside front covers, then you will add the information files that will be printed on the inside of the front covers.

Requirements
============
For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)
* Eight individual files for the images in the correct format
* Eight individual files for the inside information in the correct format

.. index:: rasterize, rotate, place file, File Place command, group layers

Steps
=====

A. Adding Images for the Outside
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Add the first image. From the *File* menu, select *Place* and browse to select the first individual image file. Click **Place**, then press **Return** to complete the file placement.

#. Rasterize: Right-click the placed image in the Layers panel, Rasterize Layer

#. Rotate image: Edit> Transform> Rotate 90° CCW. The top should be on the left.

#. Position image: Select the Move tool. Move the image to the desired spot. Images should be 3/4" away from the left and right edges, flush with top and bottom edges, and flush against each other. Hide the background layer so that you can see any white image edges better.

#. Place second image, rasterize, rotate.

#. Position second image.

#. Place third and fourth images, rasterize, rotate, position. Check that fourth image is flush with the bottom of the page.

#. Place fifth image, rasterize, rotate, position.

#. Place sixth, seventh, and eighth images, rasterize, rotate, position.

#. Group eight layers. Name group "images". Hide group.

B. Adding Information on the Inside
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Pick correct information file. Insert the information files in the same order as you inserted the image files. However, you will be positioning them from right to left instead of left to right. File> Place.

#. Rasterize. Rotate in other direction. Edit> Transform> Rotate 90° CW. Position it.  Rotate in the opposite direction of the related image, on the same horizontal row, but on the opposite left vs right side as the image. The top should be on the right. Use same margins and being flush as for the images.

#. Place remaining seven images, rasterize, rotate, position.

#. Group eight layers. Name group "info".

#. File> Save the file with a meaningful filename.
