Setting Up Photoshop
####################

.. index:: Photoshop

In this section, you will create a new Photoshop file and set up the gridlines.

Requirements
============
For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)

.. index:: gridlines

Steps
=====

#. From the *File* menu, select *New*. Set the *Width* to **3200px** (8") and the *Height* to **4200px** (10.5"). Set the *Resolution* to **400 pixels/inch** and the *Color Mode* to **RGB Color**.

.. note:: We use a page size smaller than 8.5" x 11" to avoid our printer shifting the margins slightly, which would result in misalignment between printing on the front and back sides of the same sheet of paper.

.. note:: We use 400 pixels/inch instead of our usual 300 because otherwise we could not place our small individual files exactly on the pixels we want.)

#. Gridlines: Edit> Preferences> Guides, Grid, & Slices..> Gridline every 1", Subdivisions 4, click OK.

#. View grid: View> Show Grid> make sure it is checked

#. Snap: > View> Snap to> make sure Grid is checked (this will make it easy to place individual files)

Next
====
Now you are ready to add individual images to the new file.
