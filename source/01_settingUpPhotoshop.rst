Setting Up Photoshop
####################

.. index:: Photoshop

In this section, you will create a new Photoshop file and set up gridlines.

Requirements
============
For the steps shown below, you will need:

* Computer running Photoshop (we are using Adobe Creative Suite CS4 for Windows 10)

.. index:: gridlines

Steps
=====

#. File> New> width: 3200px (8"); height 4200px (10.5"); 400dpi, RGB mode. (Because at 300dpi Photoshop will round the pixels to a size we don't want.) (Reason for size not being 8.5x11 is the way I align it  exactly when printing two-sided, otherwise my printer shifts the other side slightly)
#. Gridlines: Edit> Preferences> Guides, Grid, & Slices..> Gridline every 1", Subdivisions 4, click OK.
#. View grid: View> Show Grid> make sure it is checked
#. Snap: > View> Snap to> make sure Grid is checked (this will make it easy to place individual files)

Next
====
Now you are ready to add individual images to the new file.
